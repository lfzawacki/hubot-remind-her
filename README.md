# Hubot Remind Her

Hubot script to manage reminders in a relaxed friendly syntax.

## Features

* Both relative ("in 5 minutes") and absolute ("tomorrow 5
  pm") time specification.
* Relaxed syntax. It simply DWYM (Does what you mean) without
  expecting much grammar.
* Uses friendly relative date in the confirmation message.
* Recurrent reminders.
* Listing and deleteing existing reminders.

## Installation

Install the npm package

    npm install mx4492/hubot-remind-her --save

and add *hubot-remind-her* to `external-scripts.json`

    [ "hubot-remind-her" ]

Note: This script will not work in conjuction with [remind.coffee][] and
[hubot-remind-at][], so disable them if you are enabling this.

Remember to set your timezone correctly. For example, on heroku you need to run
`heroku config:set TZ="foo"`

## Usage

If it is prefixed with `remind`, and ends with `to <something>`, and
has a date in between, it'll work.

```
> hubot remind me in every 10 minutes to have fun
> hubot remind me tomorrow 10 PM to eat
> hubot remind me at 18 Feb to be alive
> hubot remind me every Tuesday to watch pogo
> hubot list reminders
> hubot delete reminder 1
```

To get detailed help about the sort of time strings supported, see the
[chrono][] homepage.

## Tests

The first time around, you'll need to install the necessary development
dependencies required to run the tests:

    npm install

Subsequently, you can run the tests using:

    npm test

## History/Credits

This is a spiritual successor of the [remind.coffee][] and the
[hubot-remind-at][] scripts, combining their functionality, making the
command syntax more flexible, and the bot's responses more friendly.
All thanks to the awesomeness of [chrono][] and [moment.js][].

## Bugs

* Reminders longer that 24 days in the future are immediately
  triggered ([Reference][long-settimeout]).
